# Toolchain
  - C++20 (no real excuse to use old standards)
  - C++ Modules (header files are disgusting)
  - Meson (less abhorrent than Make or CMake)
  - OpenCV (most mature computer vision library around)
  - Clang (has better linting, formatting, and module support)
  - LLD (because even linkers need to be specified...)
  - ccache (for some reason this isn't the default?)
